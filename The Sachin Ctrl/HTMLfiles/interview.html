                    <p>
                        A data structure is a way of organizing data so that the data can be
                        used efficiently. Different kinds of data structures are suited to
                        different kinds of applications, and some are highly specialized for
                        specific tasks. For example, B-trees are particularly well-suited for
                        the implementation of databases, while compiler implementations
                        usually use hash tables to look up identifiers.

                    <summary>What are linear and non-linear data Structures? </summary>
                    <p>
                        <b>Linear:- </b> A data structure is said to be linear if its elements form a
                        sequence or a linear list. Examples: Array. Linked List, Stacks and Queues
                        <br><b>Non-Linear:- </b> A data structure is said to be non-linear if the traversal
                        of nodes is nonlinear in nature. Example: Graph and Trees.

                    <p>
                        <b>Insertion </b> ? Add a new data item in the given collection of data items.
                        <br> <b>Deletion </b> ? Delete an existing data item from the given collection of data items.
                        <br> <b>Traversal </b> ? Access each data item exactly once so that it can be processed.
                        <br> <b>Searching </b> ? Find out the location of the data item if it exists in the given
                        collection of data items.
                        <br><b>Sorting </b> ? Arranging the data items in some order i.e. in ascending or descending
                        order in case of numerical data and in dictionary order in case of alphanumeric data.

                    <summary>Why Create Data Structures?</summary>
                    <p>
                        Data structures serve a number of important functions in a program. They ensure that each line
                        of code performs its function correctly and efficiently, they help the programmer
                        identify and fix problems with his/her code, and they help to create a clear and
                        organized code base

                    <summary>Can you explain the difference between file structure and storage structure?</summary>
                    <p>
                        <b>File Structure:</b> Representation of data into secondary or auxiliary memory say any device
                        such as a hard disk or pen drives that stores data which remains intact until manually deleted
                        is known as a file structure representation.
                        <br> <b>Storage Structure:</b> In this type, data is stored in the main memory i.e RAM, and is
                        deleted once the function that uses this data gets completely executed.
                        The difference is that the storage structure has data stored in the memory of the computer
                        system, whereas the file structure has the data stored in the auxiliary memory.

                    <summary>Describe the types of Data Structures?</summary>
                    <p>
                        <b>Linear Data Structure:</b> A data structure that includes data elements arranged sequentially
                        or
                        linearly, where each element is connected to its previous and next nearest elements, is referred
                        to as a linear data structure.
                        Arrays and linked lists are two examples of linear data structures.
                        <br><b>Non-Linear Data Structure:</b> Non-linear data structures are data structures
                        in which data elements are not arranged linearly or sequentially.
                        We cannot walk through all elements in one pass in a non-linear data
                        structure, as in a linear data structure. Trees and graphs are two
                        examples of non-linear data structures.

                    <summary>What is a stack data structure? What are the applications of stack?</summary>
                    <p>
                        A stack is a data structure that is used to represent the state of an
                        application at a particular point in time. The stack consists of a series
                        of items that are added to the top of the stack and then removed from the
                        top. It is a linear data structure that follows a particular order in which
                        operations are performed. LIFO (Last In First Out) or FILO (First In Last
                        Out) are two possible orders. A stack consists of a sequence of items.
                        The element that's added last will come out first, a real-life example
                        might be a stack of clothes on top of each other. When we remove the
                        cloth that was previously on top, we can say that the cloth that was added
                        last comes out first. <br> <br>
                        Following are some applications for stack data structure:
                    <ol>
                        <li>It acts as temporary storage during recursive operations</li>

                    <summary> What are different operations available in stack data structure?</summary>
                    <p>
                        Some of the main operations provided in the stack data structure are:
                    <ol>
                        <li><b>push:</b> This adds an item to the top of the stack. The overflow condition occurs if the
                            stack is
                            full.</li>
                        <li><b>pop: </b> This removes the top item of the stack. Underflow condition occurs if the stack
                            is empty.</li>
                        <li><b>top: </b> This returns the top item from the stack.</li>
                        <li><b>isEmpty: </b> This returns true if the stack is empty else false.</li>
                        <li><b>size: </b> This returns the size of the stack.</li>

                    <summary> What is a queue data structure? What are the applications of queue?</summary>
                    <p>
                        A queue is a linear data structure that allows users to store items in a list in a systematic
                        manner. The items are added to the queue at the rear end until they are full, at which point
                        they are removed from the queue from the front. Queues are commonly used in situations where
                        the users want to hold items for long period of time, such as during a checkout process. A
                        good example of a queue is any queue of customers for a resource where the first consumer is
                        served first.
                        <br> <br> Following are some applications of queue data structure:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Breadth-first search algorithm in graphs</li>
                        <li>Operating system: job scheduling operations, Disk scheduling, CPU scheduling etc.</li>

                    <summary>What is a Linked List and What are its types? </summary>
                    <p>
                        A linked list is a linear data structure (like arrays) where each element is a separate object.
                        Each
                        element (that is node) of a list is comprised of two items – the data and a reference to the
                        next node.
                        Types of Linked List : <br> <br>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            <b>Singly Linked List: </b> In this type of linked list, every node stores address or
                            reference of
                            the next node in the list and the last node has next address or reference as NULL. For
                            example 1->2->3->4->NULL
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Doubly Linked List: </b>Here, here are two references associated with each node, One of
                            the reference points
                            to the next node and one to the previous node. Eg. NULL<-1<->2<->3->NULL
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Circular Linked List :</b> Circular linked list is a linked list where all nodes are
                            connected to form a circle.
                            There is no NULL at the end. A circular linked list can be a singly circular linked list or
                            a doubly circular linked
                            list. Eg. 1->2->3->1 [The next pointer of the last node is pointing to the
